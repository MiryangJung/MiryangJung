## Hi! I'm Miryang 🕶️
I am a Frontend Engineer with 5+ years of experience in the startup industry.

I am passionate about building user-friendly and engaging web applications.

I enjoy actively participating in projects from the planning stage, contributing ideas, and engaging in intense discussions to produce optimal results that I then implement into code with a sense of immersion and accomplishment.
